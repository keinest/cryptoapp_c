                RSA Cryptosystem and Its Working Principle

The RSA cryptosystem (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm 
widely used to secure communications over the Internet. It is based on the difficulty 
of the prime factorization problem.

        1. Basic Principle
    
    RSA is a public-key encryption system, meaning it uses a pair of keys:
        
        .A public key (used for encrypting messages).
        .A private key (used for decrypting messages).
    
    The security of RSA relies on the fact that multiplying two large prime numbers 
is easy, but finding these prime numbers from their product (factoring large integers) 
is extremely difficult.

    2. Key Generation
        
    Choose two large prime numbers p and q.
    
        .Compute their product:
            .n = p x q. The value n is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys.
        
        .Compute Euler's totient function:
            
            phi(n) = (p - 1)x(q - 1). This function is needed to determine the exponent of the key.
            
        .Choose an integer e (public exponent) such that: 
            1 < e < phi(n) and gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1(meaning that e must be coprime with phi(n)).
        .Compute the private exponent d:
                d = e^-1 mod phi(n). d is the modular inverse of e modulo phi(n).
        
        The generated keys are:

            .Public key: (e,n)
            .Private key: (d,n)

    3. Encryption and Decryption
        
            @Encryption
    
To encrypt a message M (represented in numeric form) using the public key (e,n):
        C = M^e mod n where C is the encrypted message.
        
            @Decryption
    
The recipient, possessing the private key (d,n), can retrieve M using:
    M = C^d mod n
    
    4. RSA Security
    
The security of RSA mainly relies on:
    .The difficulty of factoring a large number n into its prime factors p and q.
    .The difficulty of computing the modular inverse without knowing phi(n).
        
However, RSA can be vulnerable to certain attacks if the keys are not large enough
(typically, a key of at least 2048 bits is recommended today).

            5. Applications of RSA
    
    RSA is used in:
        .Data encryption (e.g. SSL/TLS for securing websites).
        .Authentication and digital signatures.
        .Secure key exchange in hybrid cryptographic protocols.

RSA remains one of the most fundamental algorithms in modern cryptography, despite the emergence of faster
and more secure alternatives like ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
